		<h1>Readme</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
		First off all, we wanted to say that we are very enjoyed taking this course. <br />
		We think such course should be required in that degree. <br />
		Refael and Avi are professionals, and they teach us very well. <br />
		<strong>We would prefer to learn angular instead of backbone</strong>

		<h2>About the assignment</h2>
		<p>We created a server using our HTTP module (from task 4) <br />
		The server functions as a WebService - it gets requests from the client and answer with JSON of data <br />
		We used redis to save users uuid-id map (as you suggested),
		We used socket.io on client side and server side to inform user on new mail in real time <br />
		In the client side, we used backbone, <br />
		we used the todo-mvc app as a "template" for the mail application, <br />
		we relied on backbone REST functionallity in order to get/insert/update/delete data from the server <br />
		we used bootstrap to design the pages with clear & beautiful responsive design <br />
